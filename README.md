# WebReverseEngineering


This repository contains a web application developed with ASP.NET Core, using Entity Framework Core for data access and MySQL as the database management system. The project is structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and includes a complete CRUD interface generated from database reverse engineering.

Key Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Core: A modern and robust framework for web development.
Entity Framework Core (EF Core): ORM for easy data access and manipulation.
MySQL: Relational database management system.
MVC (Model-View-Controller): Architectural pattern to separate application concerns.
Reverse Engineering: Automatic generation of models and context from an existing database.
